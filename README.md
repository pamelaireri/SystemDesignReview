# SystemDesignReview
The system design activity starts after the system requirements analysis has been completed.
##  What is System Design ## 
Is the process of defining the components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisy specified requirements. 
##  The Purpose of System Design ## 
The purpose of the System Design process is to provide sufficient detailed data and information about the system and its system elements to enable the implementation consistent with architectural entities as defined in models and views of the system architecture (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 [ISO 2015]).
##  System Goals ## 
- Performance
- Reliability
- Availability
- Consistency
- Scalability
- Security
- Versatility
- Modularity/Simplicity 
## Trade Offs to Consider ##
- Availability vs. consistency 
- Scalability vs. reliability 
- Reliability vs. performance 
- Performance vs. modularity 
-  Modularity vs. versatility
